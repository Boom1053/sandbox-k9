## Overview

This script allows you to retrieve a police dog, and then use it to follow or attack targets. The dog will only attack when you are pointing a weapon. In addition, it lets you make the dog sit, stand, lay down, search players, vehicles, and areas. You can also put the dog in a vehicle.

## How to Use

1. **Retrieve a Dog:**  
   Retrieve a dog from the location specified in the configuration file.

2. **Keybind Setup:**

   - Bind your preferred key in the configuration file, or set it in-game through your settings.
   - Use your defined keybind to open the K9 commands menu, which lets you choose to attack a player, follow a player, make the dog sit, stand, lay down, search players, vehicles, and areas. You can also put the dog in a vehicle.

3. **Attacking:**  
   Make sure you are pointing a weapon at a player when you press the attack keybind.
